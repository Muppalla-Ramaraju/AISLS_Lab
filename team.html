                        <p class="role">Doctoral Researcher</p>
                        <p>I specialize in leveraging artificial intelligence for sustainable livestock systems in my role as a Doctoral Researcher at Texas A&M University. My research focus is on developing advanced AI models and algorithms to address critical challenges in agricultural production systems, particularly Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) in US beef cattle systems. Additionally, I engage in cutting-edge research to create economic decision models for feedlot and veterinary syndromic surveillance systems.</p>
                        <p>My work involves implementing precision livestock technology projects aimed at improving disease detection and management. I contribute to the development of innovative solutions that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of livestock production by utilizing data analytics and AI algorithms. My responsibilities also include conducting epidemiological research and disease modeling, which are vital for advancing our understanding and management of diseases.</p>
                        <p>Through my role, I collaborate with interdisciplinary teams and engage with various stakeholders to ensure the practical application of our research findings. My work advances scientific knowledge and has significant implications for public health and the sustainability of livestock systems. My contributions are geared towards creating a more resilient and productive agricultural sector through the integration of artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
